## About The Project

![Product Name Screen Shot](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5a0b1aba90bcce4bd55450fb/5fdefbcf-4e6b-46b0-8c09-9c04dec8a98b/z_graph.png)

XMachina's Finance Dept., while able to confidently predict X hardware (HW) sales two years out, has struggled to produce accurate revenue forecasts for the maintenance (MA) side of their business, which is similar to Apple Care but for legacy servers. This is a problem for Finance, as these forecasts are the basis for  long-term budgets as well as short-term business decisions.  As a Data Scientist familiar with financial data, we have been asked to forecast MA revenue for one of XMachina's flagship brands, X.  The CFO is particularly interested in having reliable automated forecasts that extend beyond 6 months, with an ideal time horizon of 24 months and a consistent accuracy of 92% or above.  Fortunately, upon initial inspection, X’s historical 10-year monthly MA revenue seems to follow a predictable pattern that may allow us to deliver on the CFO's expectations.  The challenge, however, will be to factor in the relationship between HW, MA, as well as X’s unique 2-year product life cycle.
