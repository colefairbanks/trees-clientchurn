# Helping Banks Prevent Client Churn Using Decision Tree Algorithms

*Binary Classification Using Tree-Based ML Methods*

### Project Summary

This client churn project consists of a binary classification model that predicts which bank customers are likely to exit.  Knowing it is generally more expensive to acquire a new customer than retain an existing one, the ultimate goal is to prevent churn by providing the bank with a list of at-risk customers. The model itself showcases tree-based methods like decision trees, random forests, and includes boosting methods such as AdaBoost and XGBoost. Additionally, there is a Deployment section that dicusses a few practicle MLOps ideas.  Finally, there is Business Value-Add section that covers cost savings and real world implications.

### Data Source

The following client churn data contains 11 feature columns and 1 target column, "Exited."  It can be found at:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mathchi/churn-for-bank-customers


* churn.csv: Client churn data for bank customers. Contains variables:

    * CustomerId: contains random values and has no effect on customer leaving the bank
    * Surname: the surname of a customer has no impact on their decision to leave the bank.
    * CreditScore: can have an effect on customer churn, since a customer with a higher credit score is less likely to leave the bank.
    * Geography: a customer’s location can affect their decision to leave the bank.
    * Gender: it’s interesting to explore whether gender plays a role in a customer leaving the bank.
    * Age: this is certainly relevant, since older customers are less likely to leave their bank than younger ones.
    * Tenure: refers to the number of years that the customer has been a client of the bank. Normally, older clients are more loyal and less likely to leave a bank.
    * Balance: also a very good indicator of customer churn, as people with a higher balance in their accounts are less likely to leave the bank compared to those with lower balances.
    * NumOfProducts: refers to the number of products that a customer has purchased through the bank.
    * IsActiveMember: active customers are less likely to leave the bank.
    * EstimatedSalary: as with balance, people with lower salaries are more likely to leave the bank compared to those with higher salaries.
    * Exited: whether or not the customer left the bank.
